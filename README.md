### deps

Not used much at the moment (storing dependencies)

### exp-shared

Usually scripts that are shared between experiments.

### exp01-create-arff

Ignore this, it was an old experiment based around computing alignments for sequences
and extracting features from the alignments. But this was cumbersome and has been
succeeded by `exp03-freq`.

### exp03-freq

Experiments with Weka's Naive Bayes classifier on a "kmer frequency" dataset.

### output

Output files from the different experiments.
